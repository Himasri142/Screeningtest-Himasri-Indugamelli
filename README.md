# Screeningtest-Himasri-Indugamelli
Recreated web screens and designed mobile versions.

Understanding the screens
   Carefully reviewed the structures and UI patterns of the three original screens.

Recreating the web screens
   Matched layout using consistent spacing, grid alignment and color theory.
   Ensured color palate and icons reflected the original style.
   Recreated bar charts, donut charts, and the analytics graphs with placeholder
   data using figma shapes and plugins.
   
Designing Mobile versions
   Translated each web screen into mobile layout using adaptive, responsive 
   principles.
   Prioritized essential content on smaller screens.
   Converted side by side elements into stacked layouts for better readability on
   mobile.
Optimized button size, font legibility and spacing for touch interactions.
