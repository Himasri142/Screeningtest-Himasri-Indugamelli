Recreated web screens and designed mobile versions.
Understanding the screens
Carefully reviewed the structures and UI patterns of the three original screens.
Recreating the web screens

Ensured color palate and icons reflected the original style.
Recreated bar charts, donut charts, and the analytics graphs with placeholder
      data using figma shapes and plugins.
Designing Mobile versions
Translated each web screen into mobile layout using adaptive, responsive 
      principles.
Prioritized essential content on smaller screens.
Converted side by side elements into stacked layouts for better readability on
      mobile.
